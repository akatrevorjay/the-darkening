the-darkening
=============

Stylus/Stylish theme.

* If using Stylish and not Stylus, a Tampermonkey script is included to tag iframes as iframes since there is no good
  way to tell such things from CSS (wat).
* With Stylus, the Tampermonkey script is *not* required, but if you want to install it anyway, I won't stop you. Go for
  it, killer.

The script is not required, but recommended. It's a tiny one liner used to realize if we're in an iframe or not.
Without the script active, iframes will not be darkened.

* Style (`theme.css`): https://userstyles.org/styles/137141/the-darkening

* When using Stylish, optional script to also blacken iframes: (`theme.js`): https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/26202-the-darkening
  Also, you may want to look into switching to the fork, it's quite better already and doesn't have the same politics getting
  features into Stylish does.

Well what does it look like?
